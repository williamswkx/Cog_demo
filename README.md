# Cognitive Services Workshop

This repository contains two complete samples showing how to use different cognitive services. The [ASP.NET Core version](https://github.com/jcocchi/CognitiveServicesDemo/tree/master/dotnet) is using the [Microsoft Cognitive Services Emotion API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/emotion-api) and the [Node.js Express](https://github.com/jcocchi/CognitiveServicesDemo/tree/master/node/cogServ) version is using the [Custom Vision Service API](https://customvision.ai).

Both versions of this workshop walk you through how to make an api call, parse the JSON response, and display results based on the response from the apis. These workshops are meant to be a jumping off point to get you started with Cognitve Services, so feel free to customize your site at the end and make it your own!
